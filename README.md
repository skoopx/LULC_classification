# LULC_classification
This study looks at the intricate interaction between LULC characteristics and economic growth at the state's level. Our goal is to reveal the intricate relationships between different land cover classes and important economic indicators using remote sensing technology and powerful LULC classification algorithms. We analyze their accuracy in classifying different land categories through an examination of the EuroSAT dataset, which comprises 64x64 images captured by the Sentinel-2A satellite. This dataset encapsulates the rich tapestry of our planet's surface, offering over 27,000 images spread across ten distinct classes . 
CNN, YOLOv8, ResNet50, and VGG16 are the models trained with the data set. With an impressive accuracy metric of 97.4\%, our results show how well YOLOv8 performs in a variety of situations when compared to other models. Following this, we convert the GDP estimates from 2012 to 2023 into a dataset reflecting different economic sectors before moving into GDP regression analysis. We forecast GDP values for 2023â€“2030 using linear regression modeling, highlighting industries with strong growth potential. Our outcomes spotlight the critical position that the categorised land class performs in monetary development and provide insightful statistics for selection-making and environmentally pleasant planning. The current studies bridges the space among environmental science and financial evaluation with the aid of presenting large insights into sustainable planning, aid control, and evidence-based choice-making at numerous administrative tiers. Hence, by classifying land and predicting GDP growth, informed decisions can guide activities for boosting economic development.
